    <h1>After School</h1>
    After shool I like Stay in Cross Country Practice, talk with my El Salvador Friends, go to my home and watch tv or watch videos on the computer, also I like go to eat or go to Starbucks.

    Also I like do many things and enter in many Things like Programs, Right now I am in 2 programs: Mission Bit and Minds Matter.
